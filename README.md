# Persuasive vs. Deceptive Visualization

Two opposing visualizations built from the same dataset to demonstrate how design choices can influence interpretation.  
**Live demo:** [View Project](https://zmosds.github.io/persuasive_or_deceptive/)

## Goal
The goal of this project is to show how visual design, framing, and data transformation can be used to either support or undermine a proposition — even when both visualizations are based on the same underlying data.

## Built With
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Features
- Two contrasting visualizations built from a single dataset  
- Selective data filtering, framing, and visual encoding to shape narrative  
- Side-by-side persuasive and deceptive design choices  
- Ethical reflection on visualization as rhetorical media  
- Fully deployed as a standalone page within a portfolio site
