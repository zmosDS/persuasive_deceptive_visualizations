      <h2>Persuasive or Deceptive Visualizations?</h2>
      <p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Younger officers receive more complaints than older officers.</p>
      <p>
        This project explores how visualization design choices shape perception.  
        Two opposing visualizations were created using NYPD complaint data:  
        one persuasive and deceptive, and the other analytical and earnest.
      </p>

    <section id="viz1" class="viz-section">
      <h2>Visualization 1 — “Complaints Surge Among Younger Officers”</h2>
      <figure>

      </figure>

      <h3>Design Intent</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization persuades viewers that younger officers receive most complaints.  
        It relies on emotional framing, vivid color, and selective context to strengthen the argument.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Transformations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Grouped total complaints by officer age using raw counts.</li>
        <li>Omitted normalization by officer count to amplify differences.</li>
        <li>Filtered ages 20–55 for a focused distribution.</li>
        <li>Binned ages in two-year intervals for smoother shape.</li>
        <li><em>Considered adding contextual information (e.g., number of officers per age group) but excluded it to maintain a cleaner, more impactful visual.</em></li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Key Design Decisions</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Design Choice</th><th>Score (-2 to +2)</th><th>Rationale</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Unnormalized counts</td><td>-1</td><td>Inflates apparent differences between age groups.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Truncated x-axis (20–55)</td><td>-.5</td><td>Centers viewer on dramatic range of data.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Red sequential palette</td><td>-1</td><td>Associates youth with urgency or misconduct.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Loaded title language</td><td>-1.5</td><td>Encourages causal interpretation of age and complaints.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Peak annotation and colorbar</td><td>0</td><td>Improves readability without data distortion.</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p class="brief-rationale">
        Though factually accurate, the design exaggerates differences through color and framing.  
        It demonstrates how omission and rhetorical tone can mislead viewers without altering raw data.

      <h2>Visualization 2 — “Complaint Rates Remain Steady Across Officer Ages”</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Pro_Young_Officer_Final.png" alt="Line chart showing steady complaint rates across ages">
        <figcaption>
          Normalized line chart illustrating consistent complaint rates when adjusted for officer population.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Design Intent</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization offers a calm, normalized view showing that complaint rates  
        remain steady across ages when adjusted for the number of officers.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Transformations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Grouped complaints and officer counts by age.</li>
        <li>Calculated complaints per officer (complaints ÷ officers).</li>
        <li>Applied rolling mean to smooth noise.</li>
        <li>Restricted to ages 20–55 for consistent comparison.</li>
        <li>Added ±1 standard deviation band to convey uncertainty.</li>
        <li><em>Considered including additional demographic variables (e.g., gender or ethnicity) but chose to isolate age to maintain a clear and interpretable comparison.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Design Decisions</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Design Choice</th><th>Score (-2 to +2)</th><th>Rationale</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Normalization by officer count</td><td>+2</td><td>Reveals proportional complaint rates fairly.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Smoothed line (rolling mean)</td><td>+1.5</td><td>Clarifies overall trend and reduces noise.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Shaded variability band</td><td>+1</td><td>Shows uncertainty transparently.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Neutral blue palette</td><td>+.5</td><td>Conveys calm, analytical tone.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Balanced y-axis (0.6–1.8)</td><td>+0.5</td><td>Visually stabilizes trend while staying truthful.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Explanatory average line and label</td><td>+1</td><td>Provides context for interpreting rates.</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p class="brief-rationale">
        This chart mirrors the first but reframes the data ethically.  
        Normalization and clear labeling promote transparency, encouraging interpretation rather than emotional reaction.

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Building these opposing visualizations of NYPD complaint data revealed how subtle design choices can dramatically shape interpretation.  
        The first visualization came together quickly. Color, framing, and simple counts were enough to create a strong, emotionally persuasive narrative.  
        The second took more deliberate work to normalize, label, and present fairly. That contrast showed me how much effort honest visualization really requires.
    </p>
    <p>
        I realized that ethical deception does not always come from manipulation. Sometimes it comes from how easy it is to stop at the surface.  
        My first chart never lied; it used accurate counts. But by excluding population context, it told a story that felt complete to most viewers.  
        Even a curious reader could accept it as truth without realizing how normalization would change the message.  
        It takes an informed, analytical mindset to notice what is not shown.  
        That insight reshaped my understanding of visualization ethics. A chart can be technically honest yet ethically incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project taught me that persuasion and ethics are separated not by data accuracy, but by intent and transparency.  
        Ethical visualization does not avoid narrative; it acknowledges it openly and gives viewers the context they need to interpret responsibly.  
        Both of my charts tell a story drawn from the same data. The difference lies in whether they invite reflection or reinforce assumption.  
        The line between persuasion and deception is not fixed, but the responsibility to keep it visible belongs to the designer.
