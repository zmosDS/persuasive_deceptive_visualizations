      <h2>Project 2: Persuasive or Deceptive Visualizations</h2>
      <p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Younger officers receive more complaints than older officers.</p>
      <p>
        This project explores how visualization design choices shape perception.  
        Two opposing visualizations were created using NYPD complaint data:  
        one persuasive and deceptive, and the other analytical and earnest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="viz1" class="viz-section">
      <h2>Visualization 1 — “Complaints Surge Among Younger Officers”</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Anti_Young_Officer_Final.png" alt="Histogram showing higher complaint counts among younger officers">
        <figcaption>
          Red histogram emphasizing a surge in complaints among younger officers.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Design Intent</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization persuades viewers that younger officers receive most complaints.  
        It relies on emotional framing, vivid color, and selective context to strengthen the argument.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Transformations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Grouped total complaints by officer age using raw counts.</li>
        <li>Omitted normalization by officer count to amplify differences.</li>
        <li>Filtered ages 20–55 for a focused distribution.</li>
        <li>Binned ages in two-year intervals for smoother shape.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Design Decisions</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Design Choice</th><th>Score (-2 to +2)</th><th>Rationale</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Unnormalized counts</td><td>-2</td><td>Inflates apparent differences between age groups.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Truncated x-axis (20–55)</td><td>-1</td><td>Centers viewer on dramatic range of data.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Red sequential palette</td><td>-1.5</td><td>Associates youth with urgency or misconduct.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Loaded title language</td><td>-1.5</td><td>Encourages causal interpretation of age and complaints.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Peak annotation and colorbar</td><td>0</td><td>Improves readability without data distortion.</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p class="brief-rationale">
        Though factually accurate, the design exaggerates differences through color and framing.  
        It demonstrates how omission and rhetorical tone can mislead viewers without altering raw data.
      </p>

    <section id="viz2" class="viz-section">
      <h2>Visualization 2 — “Complaint Rates Remain Steady Across Officer Ages”</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Pro_Young_Officer_Final.png" alt="Line chart showing steady complaint rates across ages">
        <figcaption>
          Normalized line chart illustrating consistent complaint rates when adjusted for officer population.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Design Intent</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization offers a calm, normalized view showing that complaint rates  
        remain steady across ages when adjusted for the number of officers.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Transformations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Grouped complaints and officer counts by age.</li>
        <li>Calculated complaints per officer (<code>complaints ÷ officers</code>).</li>
        <li>Applied rolling mean (window = 5) to smooth noise.</li>
        <li>Restricted to ages 20–55 for consistent comparison.</li>
        <li>Added ±1 standard deviation band to convey uncertainty.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Design Decisions</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Design Choice</th><th>Score (-2 to +2)</th><th>Rationale</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Normalization by officer count</td><td>+2</td><td>Reveals proportional complaint rates fairly.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Smoothed line (rolling mean)</td><td>+1.5</td><td>Clarifies overall trend and reduces noise.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Shaded variability band</td><td>+1</td><td>Shows uncertainty transparently.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Neutral blue palette</td><td>+1</td><td>Conveys calm, analytical tone.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Balanced y-axis (0.6–1.8)</td><td>+0.5</td><td>Visually stabilizes trend while staying truthful.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Explanatory average line and label</td><td>+1</td><td>Provides context for interpreting rates.</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p class="brief-rationale">
        This chart mirrors the first but reframes the data ethically.  
        Normalization and clear labeling promote transparency, encouraging interpretation rather than emotional reaction.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Building these opposing visualizations revealed how subtle design decisions can shift interpretation.  
        The deceptive chart came together quickly through framing and color,  
        while the earnest chart required more thoughtful transformation and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visualization is never neutral. Small stylistic choices—titles, scales, colors—carry rhetorical weight.  
        Persuasion becomes unethical when essential context is hidden or scale is distorted.  
        Persuasive storytelling remains ethical when the audience can still infer the underlying truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethical visualization invites interpretation rather than dictates it.  
        Both charts tell a story using the same data; the difference lies in whether the design clarifies or obscures that truth.
